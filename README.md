# Portfolio Overview

## Mountain Bike Trail Recommendation Engine

Mountain biking should be about getting out of the house and riding, not combing through pages and pages of trails trying to decide how you want to spend your hard-earned free time. The goal of the project is to provide the user with 5-10 trails that are similar to trails that they have positively rated. The user will be given a prompt to specify a location for recommendations. Giving the user the choice to specify a location will allow them to plan a specific place to ride, or they could look at their top recommendations in the U.S. so that they could choose where they want to visit.

## Craigslist Vehicle Pricing Models
  
  Craigslist has become a crucial part of the new and used vehicle markets in North America. It has become such an important marketplace that car dealerships have begun posting new and used vehicle adds on the website to gain exposure to users who want an uncomplicated approach to car shopping. With the predominant number of postings being from non-industry linked users, it could be considered a crowdsourced pricing model for new and used cars. By analyzing the prices and descriptive characteristics of the vehicles we can build predictive models for future sellers or buyers to understand what a 'good price' is for a vehicle.

Topics: Python, NumPy, Pandas, sklearn, linear-regression, Random Forest, EDA, Data Cleaning

## Oregon Timber Performance and Wildfire Analysis
  
  Oregon is the number one producer of lumber in the US, which makes it an important state for the industry. As the occurrence of wildfires has increased in the state, it would be useful to better understand how fires could have affected timber prices in the past. This exploratory data analysis project is intended to better understand timber prices in Oregon and how wildfires have been distributed across the state. This lays the groundwork for a potential machine learning project in the future.

Topics: Python, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, EDA, A/B testing, Statistical Analysis, Geographic Data


## Are Sommelier Wine Ratings Representative of The Consumer's Opinions?

  Sommelierâ€™s wine ratings are sort of a black box. They are rated out of 100, and the normal wine drinker is unlikely to ever pick out the hints of fruit (other than grapes) or tobacco in their bottle. That begs the question, why do we trust these reviews when buying a bottle of wine, when most people are looking for a good price and something that they can drink smoothly. This project explores wine ratings from different regions across the world and proposes an experiment that could verify the ratings of different wine varieties and the regions they come from.
