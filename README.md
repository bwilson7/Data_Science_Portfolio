## Oregon Timber Performance and Wildfire Analysis
  Oregon is the number one producer of lumber in the US, which makes it an important state for the industry. As the occurrence of wildfires has increased in the state, it would be useful to better understand how fires could have affected timber prices in the past. This exploratory data analysis project is intended to better understand timber prices in Oregon and how wildfires have been distributed across the state. This lays the groundwork for a potential machine learning project in the future.
