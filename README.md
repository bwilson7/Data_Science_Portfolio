## Oregon Timber Performance and Wildfire Analysis
  Oregon is the number one producer of lumber in the US, which makes it an important state for the industry. As the occurrence of wildfires has increased in the state, it would be useful to better understand how fires could have affected timber prices in the past. This exploratory data analysis project is intended to better understand timber prices in Oregon and how wildfires have been distributed across the state. This lays the groundwork for a potential machine learning project in the future.

## Are Sommelier Wine Ratings Representative of The Consumer?

  Sommelier’s wine ratings are sort of a black box. They are rated out of 100, and the normal wine drinker is unlikely to ever pick out the hints of fruit (other than grapes) or tobacco in their bottle. That begs the question of, why do we trust these reviews when buying a bottle of wine, when most people are looking for a good price and something that they can drink smoothly. This project explores wine ratings from different regions across the world and proposes an experiment that could verify the ratings of different wine varieties and the regions they come from.
